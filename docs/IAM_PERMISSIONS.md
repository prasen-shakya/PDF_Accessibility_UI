# IAM Permissions Required for PDF Accessibility UI

This document outlines the specific IAM permissions required to deploy and operate the PDF Accessibility Frontend UI.

> **Note:** This UI requires the backend PDF Accessibility solutions to be deployed first.

## Overview

The PDF Accessibility UI deployment creates a complete web application with user authentication, quota management, and secure file handling. The deployment process uses AWS CodeBuild to automate infrastructure provisioning and frontend deployment.

## Required AWS Services

The UI deployment requires access to the following AWS services:

- **AWS Amplify** - Frontend hosting and deployment
- **Amazon Cognito** - User authentication and authorization
- **AWS Lambda** - Backend logic for user management
- **Amazon API Gateway** - RESTful APIs for quota and profile management
- **AWS IAM** - Role and policy management
- **Amazon S3** - Access to backend processing buckets
- **AWS Secrets Manager** - Secure credential storage (optional)
- **AWS CloudFormation** - Infrastructure as code deployment
- **AWS CloudTrail** - Event tracking for user group changes
- **Amazon EventBridge** - Event-driven automation
- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** - Application logging and monitoring
- **AWS STS** - Temporary credential generation
- **AWS CodeBuild** - Automated deployment pipeline

## Runtime IAM Permissions

These permissions are granted to resources created during deployment for runtime operations.

### Lambda Execution Role Permissions

#### Post-Confirmation Lambda
```json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "cognito-idp:AdminUpdateUserAttributes",
        "cognito-idp:AdminAddUserToGroup",

## Security Best Practices

### Principle of Least Privilege

1. **Use Specific Resources**: Where possible, restrict permissions to specific resources rather than using `"*"`
2. **Separate Deployment and Runtime Roles**: Use different IAM roles for deployment vs. runtime operations
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and remove unused permissions

### Credential Management

1. **No Hardcoded Credentials**: Never hardcode AWS credentials in code
2. **Use IAM Roles**: Prefer IAM roles over access keys
3. **Rotate Credentials**: Regularly rotate any access keys used
4. **Enable MFA**: Require multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

### Monitoring and Compliance

1. **Enable CloudTrail**: Track all API calls for audit purposes
2. **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up alarms for suspicious activity
3. **Regular Reviews**: Review IAM policies and user permissions quarterly

### Debugging Permission Issues

1. **Check CloudFormation Events**: Most detailed error messages appear here
2. **Review CloudWatch Logs**: Lambda execution errors are logged
3. **Enable CloudTrail**: See exactly which API calls are failing
4. **Use IAM Policy Simulator**: Test permissions before deployment
