# PDF Accessibility Solutions - Frontend UI

This repository provides the **web-based user interface** for the PDF Accessibility Solutions, enabling users to easily upload, process, and download accessibility-compliant PDF documents through an intuitive web application.

> **⚠️ Important:** This is the frontend UI component. You must first deploy the [PDF Accessibility Backend](https://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_Accessibility) before deploying this UI.

## Overview

The PDF Accessibility UI connects to both PDF remediation solutions:

1. **PDF-to-PDF Remediation**: Upload PDFs and receive accessibility-improved PDFs
2. **PDF-to-HTML Remediation**: Upload PDFs and receive accessible HTML versions

The application features user authentication, quota management, real-time processing status, and secure file handling, all powered by AWS services.

## Prerequisites

### Required: Backend Deployment

**You must deploy the backend solutions first!** The UI requires at least one of the following:

- **PDF-to-PDF Backend**: Deployed from [PDF_Accessibility repository](https://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_Accessibility)
- **PDF-to-HTML Backend**: Deployed from [PDF_Accessibility repository](https://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_Accessibility)

After deploying the backend, you'll need the **S3 bucket name(s)** created during deployment.

### System Requirements

1. **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions

   - Amplify, Cognito, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, IAM, CloudFormation
   - See [IAM Permissions Guide](docs/IAM_PERMISSIONS.md) for detailed requirements

2. **AWS CloudShell access** (recommended) or AWS CLI configured locally

   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console
   - Click the CloudShell icon in the top navigation bar
   - Wait for CloudShell to initialize

3. **Backend S3 Bucket Names**
   - PDF-to-PDF bucket name (starts with `pdfaccessibility-`)
   - PDF-to-HTML bucket name (starts with `pdf2html-bucket-`)
   - At least one bucket name is required

## Automated One-Click Deployment

### Step 1: Open AWS CloudShell and Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_accessability_UI.git
cd PDF_accessability_UI
```

### Step 2: Run the Deployment Script

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Step 3: Follow the Interactive Prompts

The script will guide you through:

1. **Bucket Configuration**: Enter your backend S3 bucket names

   - PDF-to-PDF bucket name (or leave empty if not using)
   - PDF-to-HTML bucket name (or leave empty if not using)
   - At least one bucket is required

2. **Automated Deployment**: The script will:

   - Create IAM roles with necessary permissions
   - Deploy backend infrastructure (Cognito, Lambda, API Gateway)
   - Build and deploy the React frontend to Amplify
   - Configure all integrations automatically

3. **Deployment Progress**: Monitor real-time deployment status
   - Backend deployment: ~3-5 minutes
   - Frontend deployment: ~5-10 minutes

### Step 4: Access Your Application

After successful deployment, the script will display:

```
✅ Frontend deployment completed successfully!
🌐 Frontend URL: https://main.{app-id}.amplifyapp.com
```

Visit the URL to access your PDF Accessibility UI!

## Using the Application

### First-Time User Registration

1. **Navigate to the Application URL**

   - Open the Amplify URL provided after deployment

2. **Create an Account**

   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Enter your email, name, and password
   - Verify your email address

3. **Complete Your Profile**
   - On first sign-in, you'll be prompted to enter:
     - Organization name
     - Country, State, and City (optional)
   - This information helps us understand our user base

### Uploading and Processing PDFs

1. **Choose Output Format**

   - Select **PDF-to-PDF** to maintain PDF format with accessibility improvements
   - Select **PDF-to-HTML** to convert to accessible HTML format

2. **Upload Your PDF**

   - Click "Upload PDF" or drag and drop
   - File must meet your quota limits:
     - Maximum file size (default: 25 MB)
     - Maximum pages (default: 10 pages)
   - The system validates your file before upload

3. **Monitor Processing**

   - Real-time status updates
   - Processing time varies by file size and complexity
   - Typical processing: 2-5 minutes per document

4. **Download Results**
   - Once complete, download your remediated file
   - PDF-to-PDF: Accessibility-improved PDF
   - PDF-to-HTML: ZIP file containing HTML, images, and reports

### Understanding Your Quota

Your upload quota is displayed in the header:

- **Current Usage**: Number of files uploaded
- **Maximum Allowed**: Your upload limit

### Group Management

Administrators can change user groups through the AWS Cognito console:

1. Navigate to Amazon Cognito in AWS Console
2. Select the `PDF-Accessability-User-Pool`
3. Go to "Users and groups"
4. Select a user and add them to a group
5. User quotas update automatically via EventBridge

## Infrastructure Components

### AWS Resources Created

**Authentication & Authorization:**

- Amazon Cognito User Pool with custom attributes

- Three user groups (Default, Amazon, Admin)
- Hosted UI for sign-in/sign-up

**Backend APIs:**

- API Gateway REST API with Cognito authorizer
- Lambda functions for quota management
- Lambda functions for user profile updates
- EventBridge rules for automatic quota updates

**Frontend Hosting:**

- AWS Amplify application
- Automatic HTTPS and custom domain support
- SPA routing configuration

**Monitoring:**

- CloudWatch Logs for all Lambda functions
- CloudTrail for Cognito group changes
- API Gateway access logs

### Custom Cognito Attributes

The system tracks the following user attributes:

```
custom:first_sign_in          - Boolean: First login flag
custom:total_files_uploaded   - Number: Total uploads
custom:max_files_allowed      - Number: Upload limit
custom:max_pages_allowed      - Number: Page limit per PDF
custom:max_size_allowed_MB    - Number: File size limit
custom:organization           - String: User's organization
custom:country                - String: User's country
custom:state                  - String: User's state
custom:city                   - String: User's city
custom:pdf2pdf                - Number: PDF-to-PDF conversions
custom:pdf2html               - Number: PDF-to-HTML conversions
```

## Monitoring

### CloudWatch Logs

Monitor application activity through CloudWatch:

**Lambda Functions:**

- `/aws/lambda/PostConfirmationLambda` - User registration events
- `/aws/lambda/UpdateAttributesFn` - Profile updates
- `/aws/lambda/checkOrIncrementQuotaFn` - Quota checks and increments
- `/aws/lambda/UpdateAttributesGroupsFn` - Group membership changes

#### Upload Failures

**Error: "You have reached your upload limit"**

- **Cause**: Quota exceeded
- **Solution**:
  - Contact administrator to increase quota
  - Wait for quota reset (if applicable)
  - Check your current usage in the header

**Error: "File size exceeds limit"**

- **Cause**: File too large for your quota
- **Solution**:
  - Reduce PDF file size
  - Split large PDFs into smaller documents
  - Request quota increase from administrator

**Error: "PDF file cannot exceed X pages"**

- **Cause**: PDF has too many pages
- **Solution**:
  - Split PDF into smaller documents
  - Request quota increase from administrator

#### Deployment Issues

**Error: "At least one bucket name is required"**

- **Cause**: No backend buckets configured
- **Solution**: Deploy the backend first and provide bucket names

**Error: "Failed to create IAM role"**

- **Cause**: Insufficient permissions
- **Solution**: Ensure your AWS user has IAM creation permissions

**Error: "CDK deployment failed"**

- **Cause**: Various CDK-related issues
- **Solution**:
  - Check CloudFormation console for detailed errors
  - Ensure CDK is bootstrapped: `cdk bootstrap`
  - Verify all prerequisites are met

### Getting Help

- **Check CloudWatch Logs**: Most issues are logged in CloudWatch
- **Review CloudFormation Events**: Deployment issues show in CloudFormation
- **Verify Backend Deployment**: Ensure backend is deployed and accessible
